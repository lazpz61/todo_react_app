Task Manager Application - 

This repo serves the purpose of having an online storage for code when I need to utilize useState to manipulate input date to render on the screen for item that a user were to type in the input box, and hit enter or presses Add Task button. 

In the small application I was callenged with passing state to the Unorder List while setting the onSubmit property to the handleAddTask function within the application. 

I also spent a considerable amount of time working on the placement of the button in terms of the CSS of the file. I was testing both flex box - flex direction row and columm in order to acheive my desired outlook of the application.
